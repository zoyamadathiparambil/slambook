        <h1>Dreamcatcher</h1>
    <h3>
        Trapped in isolation,<br>
A Feeling of smother; arise. <br>
The distress and grief collision, <br>
A nightmare in disguise. <br> <br>

Fake friends betraying you, <br>
Solitude skating through the way. <br>
Bliss and euphoria, who? <br>
I Knew only about immense dismay. <br> <br>

There might be no one, <br>
No one to be by your side, <br>
Except, just like a small beam of sun, <br>
A hallucination abides. <br> <br>

Your dreams are like a way to light. <br>
Drift away with them. <br>
Let them control you for the night, <br>
Your fantasy is a gem. <br> <br>

Not a soul can stop you in your illusion, <br>
Like a dreamcatcher, positive visions approach. <br>
Create your characters like a magician, <br>
You are your coach. <br> <br>

Do what you love the most, <br>
Nobody can interrupt you. <br>
The place where you decide your post, <br>
A night journey anew.
